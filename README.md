## Design
To start with, several header files are included.  
_#include stdio.h_ is included for the standard input and output.  
_#include string.h_ is included for using the functions of string. For example, _strlen()_.  
_#include Windows.h_ is used under Win32 console application.  
_#include conio.h_ is included for using the function _getch()_.  
_#include stdlib.h_ is included for using various utility functions. For example, _srand()_.  
_#include time.h_ is included for the initialization of the seed of function _time()_.  
A structure of customer is added, which contains 7 variables.
_char cName[41]_ is a character array with 40 elements representing the name of the customer.  
_char cAddress[51]_ is a character array with 50 elements representing the address of the customer.  
_char cTelenumber[16]_ is a character array with 15 elements representing the telephone number of the customer.  
_char cAccount[11]_ is a character array with 10 elements representing the account number of the customer.  
_char cPIN[7]_ is a character array with 6 elements representing the password to the account.  
_int iBalance_ is an integer array representing the amount of balance.  
_int iRegister_ is an integer array representing the amount of registration.
